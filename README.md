ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, this repository hosts the completed code for a Searchmetrics Frontend Challenge


## Considerations
* Since the challenge required a QraphQL server, I've decided to opt for a monorepo strategy to facilitate the development process.
* I assumed it was not supposed to use external React component libraries so I developed all the components from scratch. 
* In favor of a faster development time, I opted to style most of the components with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
* I decided not to employ TDD in this project nor test any of the components for a couple of reasons. I have little experience with testing and felt overwhelmed having to learn and integrate a testing framework like Jest and/or Cypress.

## Instalation

1. Clone this repo, install dependencies and spin up development server.
```
npm run dev
```
**NOTE:** *If you're running on Windows and encounter problems installing dependencies, run your environment in a terminal with Administrative privileges.*
